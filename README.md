# Systems Programming Playground

Repository to play around system programming concepts like Linux Kernel Development, Systems Programming (AMD/Intel x86-64), Assembly Programming and System V ABI.

## Folder Structure

- `asm-basics/` contains basic byte-sized programs to learn 64-bit assembly.
- `linux-kernel-dev/` contains programs to learn and practice Linux Kernel Development.
- `systems-programming/` contains byte-sized programs to learn systems programming using AMD manual.
- `system-v-abi` contains topics related to System V AMD64 ABI such as code-models, ELF, Dynamic Linking, etc.

Each folder has its own README.md file which contains the description of the programs in them and the steps to build and run them.
